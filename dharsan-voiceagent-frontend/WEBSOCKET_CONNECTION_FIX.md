# WebSocket Connection Fix for Vercel Deployment

## Problem Summary
The frontend was experiencing WebSocket connection failures when deployed on Vercel due to:
1. **Mixed Content**: Frontend (HTTPS) trying to connect to HTTP/WS endpoints (blocked by browsers)
2. **Vercel Limitations**: Vercel doesn't support WebSocket servers
3. **Backend Configuration**: Backend was running HTTP instead of HTTPS
4. **Certificate Issues**: Self-signed certificates causing browser security warnings

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend HTTPS Configuration âœ…
- **Enabled HTTPS** on orchestrator: `ENABLE_HTTPS=true`
- **SSL Certificates**: Created and mounted self-signed certificates
- **LoadBalancer**: Created external access with IP `34.133.216.59:443`
- **Kafka Configuration**: Fixed Kafka broker connection
- **CORS Headers**: Added proper CORS configuration for Vercel domains

### 2. Frontend Configuration Updates âœ…
- **Secure WebSocket URLs**: Updated to use `wss://` instead of `ws://`
- **LoadBalancer IP**: Using new external IP `34.133.216.59:443`
- **Environment Variables**: Configured proper production URLs
- **WebSocket Manager**: Enhanced with secure connection handling
- **Error Handling**: Improved connection error handling and reconnection logic

### 3. LoadBalancer Service âœ…
- **External Access**: LoadBalancer IP: `34.133.216.59:443`
- **SSL Termination**: Configured SSL termination at load balancer level
- **Health Checks**: Added HTTPS health checks

## Configuration Files Updated

### Backend
- `k8s-fresh/manifests/orchestrator.yaml` - Enabled HTTPS and fixed Kafka config
- `k8s-fresh/manifests/orchestrator-loadbalancer.yaml` - Created external access with SSL
- `ssl-certificates-secret.yaml` - SSL certificates for HTTPS

### Frontend
- `src/config/production.ts` - Updated to use secure URLs
- `env.production.example` - Updated environment variables
- `src/utils/websocketManager.ts` - Enhanced WebSocket handling

## Environment Variables for Vercel

Set these environment variables in your Vercel deployment:

```bash
# Backend Service URLs (HTTPS/WSS for production)
VITE_WEBSOCKET_URL=wss://34.133.216.59:443/ws
VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://34.133.216.59:443
VITE_WHIP_URL=https://34.133.216.59:443/whip

# Service URLs
VITE_STT_SERVICE_URL=https://34.133.216.59:443/stt
VITE_TTS_SERVICE_URL=https://34.133.216.59:443/tts
VITE_LLM_SERVICE_URL=https://34.133.216.59:443/llm

# Environment
VITE_ENVIRONMENT=production

# TURN Server Credentials
VITE_TURN_USERNAME=10f1dfa42670d72b3a31482a
VITE_TURN_CREDENTIAL=FvFd4gNrt9+OZk4r
```

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Backend Health Check
```bash
curl -k https://34.133.216.59:443/health
```

### 2. WebSocket Connection Test
```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('wss://34.133.216.59:443/ws');
ws.onopen = () => console.log('Connected!');
ws.onerror = (error) => console.error('Error:', error);
```

### 3. Frontend Deployment
1. Set environment variables in Vercel
2. Deploy the updated frontend
3. Test WebSocket connections

## Current Status

- âœ… **Backend HTTPS**: Running with SSL certificates
- âœ… **LoadBalancer**: External IP `34.133.216.59:443` working
- âœ… **Kafka Connection**: Fixed and working
- âœ… **Frontend Config**: Updated for secure connections
- âœ… **Health Check**: Backend responding correctly
- âœ… **WebSocket Endpoint**: Accessible via HTTPS
- ðŸ”„ **Vercel Deployment**: Ready for deployment with new config

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Frontend**: Deploy with updated environment variables
2. **Test Connections**: Verify WebSocket connections work
3. **Monitor Logs**: Check for any remaining connection issues
4. **Browser Testing**: Test in different browsers to ensure compatibility

## Troubleshooting

### WebSocket Connection Still Fails
1. Check if backend is accessible: `curl -k https://34.133.216.59:443/health`
2. Verify SSL certificates are working
3. Check CORS configuration
4. Ensure environment variables are set correctly in Vercel

### Backend Not Accessible
1. Check LoadBalancer status: `kubectl get service orchestrator-external -n voice-agent-fresh`
2. Verify orchestrator pods are running: `kubectl get pods -n voice-agent-fresh`
3. Check orchestrator logs: `kubectl logs -n voice-agent-fresh -l app=orchestrator`

### Environment Variables Not Working
1. Verify variables are set in Vercel dashboard
2. Check if variables are prefixed with `VITE_`
3. Redeploy after setting environment variables

### Mixed Content Errors
1. Ensure all URLs use `https://` and `wss://`
2. Check that no HTTP URLs are being used
3. Verify LoadBalancer is configured for HTTPS

## Security Notes

- **Self-signed Certificates**: Currently using self-signed certificates for testing
- **Production Certificates**: For production, use proper CA-signed certificates
- **CORS Configuration**: Properly configured for Vercel domains
- **HTTPS Only**: All connections now use secure protocols
